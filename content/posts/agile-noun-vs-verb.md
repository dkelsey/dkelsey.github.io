People understand what _agility_ is.  They hear references to _agile_ is software development. Often I see that people are unclear on
the distinction.  They just don't get it.

Agile is 4 beliefs and 12 values that outline habits or beliefs which, when embraced, contributes to building the best software.

You can find the 4 beliefs on the Agile Manifesto page: https://agilemanifesto.org
The 12 values are found at

Agile, is simply ways of thinking that guide how we act and what we value.

Practices like Scrum, Kanban, Lean have _rituals_, practices, and tools that guide us dummies on how we work.
These are guides that instruct us on how to work.  While we are working, within these "ways of working" we are always,
"looking at the poster on the wall " or making choices of how we behave based on our beliefs, as outlines in the Agile Manifesto.

That's it.
