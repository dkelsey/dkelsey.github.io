## OKR 6

> Continuously improve our mature services

oh here it is:

> **OKR#1 – Continuous Service Improvement**
> Continuously improve DPD’s established services to delight clients and streamline delivery


Something like that.
Every time I looked at it, it had changed.

I sat in on the management meetings where this OKR was discussed.

My understanding of Continuous Improvement of Mature Services resonated with what I'd been reading about Capability Maturity Models. I was reading about Site Reliability Engineering and Maturity Models were brought up there.

They all start the same and as the org becomes more capable, more mature, ....

My definition of a mature services is one that is in the "Optimizing" stage.

From the meetings I observed

"tee-hee's" when it came to using the word "mature services"
I think they thought
* Grizzles
* Long in the tooth.
* out of date.
* an old fart.

I believe they took two meetings to discuss not using the label _"Mature Services"_; these meeting took place once a week.   
They managed the hell out of it and changed it to "established services."  Ug.
Mature and Legacy systems have some interesting definitions.
* the systems nobody cares about, that makes us all our money.

They were far more interested in hearing about "new and exciting features that were being added to our _mature_ services" .

## My point.

In the Agile team I was on, I pointed out, glibly, incredulously, that essentially we suck;  
* We failed to produced more than a single, minor code fix in a year.  abysmal!
* We failed to perform more than a single data update - a core accountability is to provide the latest routing and address data through continuous monthly data update cycles; we produced a single update; in a year.
