I've come to the recognition that I spend a large quantity of time, in meetings, listening to people discuss technical issues...
where they are mis-using the terms,  they do not know the components, and interactions at a technical level and they do not know
the historic context of how we arrived at the current state.

I'm on a project that has operated off the corner of a desk for 4 years.  It exists within an group which, is constantly
reacting and performing heroic acts to resolved complex technical issues. We've all slipped into bad habits.

## The bad habits I see are:
* not organizing information in a way that can be shared -- we don't stop and write things down or draw pictures.
* we don't stop and introspect: what are the patterns of issues.  what re-occurs, what can be done to manage this.
* we don't advocate for ourselves: we'll work ourselves into sickness.  We want to be the hero that saves the day.

I used to think that more people and more time would fix the situation.  Now i think these would amplify the problem.
we need to change the way we work and think about how we work.
