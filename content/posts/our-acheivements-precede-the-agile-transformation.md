In a friendly conversation with former senior leader, they stated they were bringing **Agile** to the new organization they moved to.   

I assessed their perception: as 

1. They believed that they brought the Agile transformation to our group.  
2. the success of our group can only be the result of this Agile transformation.  
3. The were going to bring about change to the new organization just as they had to ours.  

## I want to examine a couple of things:

1. The definition of success; my measurement of it.
2. Did **Agile** make this group good, or was this group good already?

## Definition and Measurement of success.

## Did Agile make us good or were we already good?
