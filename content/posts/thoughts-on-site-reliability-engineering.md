I've found the [Site Reliability Engineering in converstion](https://sre.google/in-conversation/) to be the best source to begin to understand what Site Reliability Egineering is.  

As with all things, I find reading about SRE tends toward [semantic diffusion](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html).

## Good Resources

* [What is Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/)

### Read the books

* [The books](https://sre.google/books/)
* [Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/)
* [The Site Reliability Workbook](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/)

## My Thoughts 

* It came about from google's rapid growth and the need to scale.  
* Google could not hire people fast enough to keep up with growth.  
* They learned people can use their programming skills to scale their work.  
* They applied engineering to optimize challenges.  
* The saw the value of culture, empathy, and trust.


## What SRE is not

* SUPER SYSADMINS. 
* An isolated group, that can be hired, brought in, that is going to solve everything.  

## The Highlights for me

* TOIL: the continuous attention to reducing TOIL
* Service Level Objectives SLO and Error Budgets.
* Graceful Degregation.
* Blame Free Post Incident Reviews
* Wheel of Misfortune and Incident management.
* Operational Playbooks.
* SREs and SWEs are regarded similarly with similar growth and promotion rates.

### The accountabilites
* Availability.
* Latencey.
* Performance.
* Efficiency.
* Change Management.
* Monitoring.
* Emergency Response.
* Capacity Planning.
