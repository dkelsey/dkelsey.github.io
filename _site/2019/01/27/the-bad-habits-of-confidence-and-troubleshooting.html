    <p>I’ve come to the recognition that I spend a large quantity of time, in meetings, listening to people discuss technical issues…
where they are mis-using the terms,  they do not know the components, and interactions at a technical level and they do not know
the historic context of how we arrived at the current state.

<p>I’m on a project that has operated off the corner of a desk for 4 years.  It exists within an group which, is constantly
reacting and performing heroic acts to resolved complex technical issues. We’ve all slipped into bad habits.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad-habits-i-see-are">The bad habits I see are:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>not organizing information in a way that can be shared – we don’t stop and write things down or draw pictures.</li>
  <li>we don’t stop and introspect: what are the patterns of issues.  what re-occurs, what can be done to manage this.</li>
  <li>we don’t advocate for ourselves: we’ll work ourselves into sickness.  We want to be the hero that saves the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>I used to think that more people and more time would fix the situation.  Now i think these would amplify the problem.
we need to change the way we work and think about how we work.</p>
